# use import for import the functions

import math

# for ex want to get the sqrt of 25

print("sqrt of 25 is :",math.sqrt(25))
print("sqrt of 15 is :",math.sqrt(15))
print("floor of 2.9 is :",math.floor(2.9))
print("ceil of 2.2 is :",math.ceil(2.2))

# here you can use all mathemetical functions

print("The value of pow 3 of 2 is :", math.pow(3,2))
print("The value of pi is :", math.pi())

# you can use like this

import math as m # after this you just have to call m.funname()

print("Value of pi is:", m.pi)
