# use import for import the functions

import math as newMath

# for ex want to get the sqrt of 25

print("sqrt of 25 is :",newMath.sqrt(25))
print("sqrt of 15 is :",newMath.sqrt(15))
print("floor of 2.9 is :",newMath.floor(2.9))
print("ceil of 2.2 is :",newMath.ceil(2.2))

# here you can use all newMathemetical functions

print("The value of pow 3 of 2 is :", newMath.pow(3,2))
# print("The value of pi is :", newMath.pi())

# you can use like this

import math as m # after this you just have to call m.funname()

print("Value of pi is:", m.pi)
