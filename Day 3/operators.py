# arithmetic Operators

x = 2
y = 3

x + y
x - y
x * y
x / y

# assignment operators
# used symbol is "equal (=)"

x = x + 2

# x + = 2

# Both are same

a, b = 5, 6

# unary operators

n = 7

-n # got nagative value

n = -n # assign nagative value

# realational operators  returns true or false

a < b # for check it returns true or false

a == b # for compare

a > b 
a <= b  # less than or equal to
a != b  # not equal to

# logical operators AND, OR, NOT

a < 8 and b < 8
a > 8 and b < 8
a > 8 and b > 8

#complement(~)
~12 # output will be -13

print(~15) # output will be -13

# Bitwise & (AND)

#in and if both has 1 than you will get 1 otherwise you will get 0

bin(12) #output will be 0b1101
bin(13) #output will be 0b1100

12 & 13 # you will get out put 12 why the reasult on the bit.

# Bitwise | (OR)

# in bitwise or if you get at least 1 then you will get 1

12|13

# bin(13)
# '0b1101'
# bin(12)
# '0b1100'
# 12|13
