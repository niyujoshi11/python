# DataTypes in python

- Text Type:	    ```str```

- Numeric Types:	```int, float, complex```

- Sequence Types:	``` list, tuple, range```

- Mapping Type:	    ```dict```

- Set Types:	    ```set, frozenset```

- Boolean Type:	    ```bool```

- Binary Types:	    ```bytes, byte array, memory view``

- None Type:	    ```NoneType```

- use ```#``` for single comment

- use ''' For multiline comment '''

- use ```_``` for use the previous output.

- getting the type of variable use ```type(var)```.

# Multiple DP
- None, Numeric, List, Tuple, Set, string, range, Dictionary

- None is defined for null

- Numeric have multiple type like ```int```,```float```,```complex```,```bool```

# Operator

- Arithmetic operators

- Assignment operators

- Comparison operators

- Logical operators

- Identity operators

- Membership operators

- Bitwise operators

# Arithmetic Operators

- Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations: ```+```, ```-```, ```/```, ```*```, ```%```, ```**```

# Assignment operators

- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables: ```=```, ```+=```, ```-=```, ```*=```, ```/=```, ```%=```, & more....

# Comparison Operators

- Comparison operators are used to compare two values: ```==```, ```!=```, ```>```, ```<```, ```<=```, ```>==```.

# Logical Operators

- Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements: ```AND```, ```OR```, ```NOT```.

# Identity Operators

- Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location: ```is``` & ```is not```.

# Bitwise Operators

- Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:```AND```, ```OR```, ```XOR```, ```NOT```, ```Zero fill left shift```, ```Signed right shift```.

- AND: ```&``` : Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1

- OR: ```|``` : Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1

- XOR: ```^``` 	:Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1

- NOT: ``` ~ ```: 	Inverts all the bits

- Signed right shift: ```>>```: Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off

- Zero fill left  shift: ```<<``` :Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
